programming:
- Given a number N and an array Arr[], search for two numbers which sum up
  to the number N.
- Find whether there is a loop in a linked list or not.
  - Prove using graph theory?
- You are given an array of size N containing negative and positive real
  numbers. Zero may or may not be present. Rearrange the array using O(N)
  time and O(1) space so that all negative numbers come before all positive
  numbers.
- Given a monotonically sorted 2D array, create an algorithm to search for
  a given input element. A monotonically sorted array is one in which each
  row and column has elements in ascending order, e.g.
  [1, 2, 10; 4, 6, 11; 5, 7, 12;]

- Given an integer N, print 0....(N^2 - 1) in spiral form, e.g.:
32     4 3 2    15 14 13 12
01     5 0 1     4  3  2 11
       6 7 8     5  0  1 10
                 6  7  8  9

- Write a program to find out if a binary tree is balanced or not.
- Find the height of a tree.

- Calculate N!, both iteratively and recursively.
- Given a pointer to a node in a linked list, return the nth node away from
  that node.

- Sort three numbers without inserting them onto an array.
    - Extend this solution to 4 numbers.

- Given an array of numbers, divide the numbers into 2 sets, such that the
  difference between the sum of numbers in the two sets is minimized.
   - This problem is NP. generate a solution O(kn) where k is the max
     element in the array.

- Given a random function that generates a random number between 1 and 5
  inclusive, write a function to generate a random number between 1 and 7
  inclusive.

- Given a matrix of integers where every row is sorted and every column is
  sorted, print the elements in sorted order (O(n^2 logn))

- Given an array of positive integers, convert it into a sorted array with
  minimum cost. valid operations: decrement an element (cost 1), or delete
  the element (cost = value of element).
  e.g. 4, 3, 5, 6 -> delete 4, cost 1



Puzzles:
- There are 15 black and 5 white balls. Find the probability of drawing
  3 balls so that there is no white ball.
