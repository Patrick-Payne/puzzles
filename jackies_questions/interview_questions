What if you are only able to visit a page at most once?

Given a phone number (ie. 123-4567), and a text file containg all english words, return a list of 7-letter words that can be formed using that phone number. (ie. 2 maps to ABC, 3 maps to DEF, etc)
What if you were to support not only 7 letter words, but a concatentation of shorter words to make 7 letters in total? 
(ie. RACE CAR)

 Given an xml, with a Tokenizer and a Token Object, construct a tree of Nodes.

 ie. xml

        <c>foo</c>
        sometext
        <c>bar</c>
    </b>
    <d>blah</d>
    moretext
</a>

Node
    name        // ie. a
    TEXT        // ie. foo
    list<Node> children

Tokenizer
    get_token()

Token
    type    //BEGIN, TEXT, END
    value
