Coding Questions:
- How would you shuffle a deck of 52 cards (i.e. shuffle an array).
- Bit masking and field accessing etc.
- Determine the number of points in an X-Y axis plot that are within radius of
  R from point P.

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
  three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print
  “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
  “FizzBuzz”.

- How would you use a single down-counter, with very high resolution and quick
  access/set times, in software to time an arbitrary number of items?

- Binary Tree:
  - Find a specific node in a binary tree (not necessarily search tree), return
    its depth.
  - Find the average of a binary tree.
  - Reverse a binary tree.
    - both in place and in new memory. Advantages of either scheme?
  - Each node's value is a color. A clump is formed with more than 3 items
    with the same color are adjacent to each other. Return the number of
    clumps in a binary tree.

- linked lists:
  - make a deep copy of a linked list.
  - recursively and non-recursively reverse a linked list.
  - Given two singly linked lists, with hte first node being the most
    significant digit of a number and the last being the least, find their
    difference in O(n) time without reversing the lists.

PUZZLES:
- There are 5 people and each one hit a stump with a ball twice. Probability
  of each one hitting it is P, then how many people hit the stump with both
  their chances on average?
-

Systems:
- Design an Air conditioner controller
- How would you measure the temperature in a room and display the result?
- Draw a block diagram of a PC architecture and explain where and how the buses
  interact with the chipsets.
- How would you implement a text editor?
- How would you implement a calculator?
- Given a laptop with a mic plug, draw a block diagram of what you would need
  to record our conversation and store it on a USB stick.
- Software UART

  - Your most memorable and challenging bug so far, and how you solved it.

- What is your approach to debugging a program.
- What is the project you are most proud of?
- Why do you want to work for National Instruments?
- Tell us about your previous internship and the project you worked on.
